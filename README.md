# CSS Variables And Slider

## Description
An idea for this project I have found from a 30 day [challenge](https://javascript30.com/) where you complete 1 project each day in vanilla JavaScript. I have enhanced this project by incorporating a slider. Additionally, I've implemented responsive design.
